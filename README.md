# Quectel UC20 Mini PCIe prototyping board
The UC20 Mini PCIe http://www.quectel.com/product/prodetail.aspx?id=65 is a convenient choice for IoT applications and as such we wish to use it in breadboard type applications and make it compatible with Adafruit Fona 3G board. The following are the specifications for designing an adapter board.

## Specification
A board with 2.54mm header on one edge and PCIe connector on the board itself.
 * requires a 3.3V source
 * UC20 operates from the battery voltage directly, test if PCIe board can be used so as well, bypassing the on-board boost regulator
 * UART wiring as described
